# Prog6221-part-1
Sure, here's an explanation of the code, how to run it, and its features:

How to Run the Code:

This code is written in C# and requires a C# compiler and development environment to run. Here's a general guideline:

1. Install C# compiler: If you don't have one already, you can install Visual Studio Community, a free IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for C# development that includes a compiler.
2. Create a new C# project:  In Visual Studio, create a new console application project.
3. Copy and paste the code: Copy the entire code you provided and paste it into the main source file of your project (usually named `Program.cs`).
4. Run the application: Build and run the project using the built-in options in Visual Studio.

What the Code Does:

The code provides a recipe management application. Here's a breakdown of its functionalities:

Recipe Creation: It allows you to create a new recipe by entering a name.
Ingredient Management: You can specify the number of ingredients and provide details like name, quantity, and unit (grams, milliliters, etc.) for each ingredient. The code validates the quantity to ensure it's a positive number.
Step Management:  You can define the number of steps involved in the recipe and provide a description for each step.
Recipe Display: The code displays the recipe details, including the name, ingredients (quantity, unit, and name), and steps.
Recipe Scaling: The application allows you to scale the recipe by a specific factor (e.g., double the quantity of all ingredients). It validates the scaling factor to ensure it's a positive number.
Quantity Reset:  You can reset the ingredient quantities back to their original values after scaling.
Recipe Clearing:The code allows you to completely clear the current recipe and start over with a new one.

Features:

User Input: The code takes user input for various aspects of the recipe, making it interactive.
Validation: It validates user input for recipe name (no digits allowed), ingredient quantity (positive number), unit selection (from a predefined list), number of steps (positive number), and scaling factor (positive number). This helps prevent errors due to invalid data.
Looping: Loops are used to handle entering multiple ingredients and steps, making the recipe creation process more flexible.
 Methods:The code is well-organized using methods for specific tasks like adding ingredients, displaying the recipe, scaling the recipe, etc. This improves code readability and maintainability.

Overall, this code provides a basic recipe management application with functionalities for creating, editing, and scaling recipes. It incorporates validation and user interaction to enhance its robustness.
